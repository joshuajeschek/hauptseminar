  abstract = {Cyber criminals have proven to be both capable and motivated to profit from compromised personal information. The FBI has reported that victims have suffered over \$3 billion in losses through compromise of email accounts alone (IC3 2016). One security measure which has been demonstrated to be effective against many of these attacks is two-factor authentication (2FA). The FBI, the Department of Homeland Security US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), and the internationally recognized security training and awareness organization, the SANS Institute, all strongly recommend the use of two-factor authentication. Nevertheless, adoption rates of 2FA are low. This study introduced 2FA to a group of millennials as an easily accessible security tool to protect their accounts against takeover by cyber criminals. They were introduced to the purpose of 2FA and provided resources to help begin using it. This paper discusses the factors which influenced the participants' decisions to adopt or not adopt 2FA. The findings of this study will help organizational security awareness programs and 2FA service providers focus their efforts on more persuasive messages and, possibly, enhanced technologies that can improve the use of 2FA services among millennials in the future. {\copyright} 2 01 7 T he SA NS In sti tut e, Au tho r R eta ins Fu ll R igh ts {\copyright} 2017 The SANS Institute Author retains full rights.

We have shipped support for Security Keys in the Chrome web browser and in Google's online services. We show that Security Keys lead to both an increased level of security and user satisfaction by analyzing a two year deployment which began within Google and has extended to our consumer-facing web applications. The Security Key design has been standardized by the FIDO Alliance, an organization with more than 250 member companies spanning the industry. Currently, Security Keys have been deployed by Google, Dropbox, and GitHub.

  abstract = {We examined the authentication procedures used by five prepaid wireless carriers when a customer attempted to change their SIM card. These procedures are an important line of defense against attackers who seek to hijack victims' phone numbers by posing as the victim and calling the carrier to request that service be transferred to a SIM card the attacker possesses. We found that all five carriers used insecure authentication challenges that could be easily subverted by attackers. We also found that attackers generally only needed to target the most vulnerable authentication challenges, because the rest could be bypassed. Authentication of SIM swap requests presents a classic usability-security trade-off, with carriers underemphasizing security. In an anecdotal evaluation of postpaid accounts at three carriers, presented in Appendix A, we also found---very tentatively---that some carriers may have implemented stronger authentication for postpaid accounts than for prepaid accounts. To quantify the downstream effects of these vulnerabilities, we reverse-engineered the authentication policies of over 140 websites that offer phone-based authentication. We rated the level of vulnerability of users of each website to a SIM swap attack, and have released our findings as an annotated dataset on issms2fasecure.com . Notably, we found 17 websites on which user accounts can be compromised based on a SIM swap alone, i.e., without a password compromise. We encountered failures in vulnerability disclosure processes that resulted in these vulnerabilities remaining unfixed by nine of the 17 companies despite our responsible disclosure. Finally, we analyzed enterprise MFA solutions from three vendors, finding that two of them give users inadequate control over the security-usability tradeoff.}

However, 2FA mechanisms usually exhibit user experience issues that create user friction and even lead to poor acceptance, hampering the wider spread of 2FA. In this article, we investigate user perceptions of 2FA through in-depth interviews with 42 participants, revealing key requirements that are not well met today despite recently emerged 2FA solutions. First, we investigate past experiences with authentication mechanisms emphasizing problems and aspects that hamper good user experience. Second, we investigate the different authentication factors more closely. Our results reveal particularly interesting preferences regarding the authentication factor ``ownership'' in terms of properties, physical realizations, and interaction. These findings suggest a path toward 2FA mechanisms with considerably better user experience, promising to improve the acceptance and hence, the proliferation of 2FA for the benefit of security in the digital world.},

  abstract = {As text-based passwords continue to be the dominant form for user identification today, services try to protect their costumers by offering enhanced, and more secure, technologies for authentication. One of the most promising is two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA raises the bar for the attacker significantly, however, it is still questionable if the technology can be realistically adopted by the majority of Internet users. In this paper, we attempt a first study for quantifying the adoption of 2FA in probably the largest existing provider, namely Google. For achieving this, we leverage the password-reminder process in a novel way for discovering if 2FA is enabled for a particular account, without annoying or affecting the account's owner. Our technique has many challenges to overcome, since it requires issuing massively thousands of password reminders. In order to remain below the radar, and therefore avoid solving CAPTCHAs or having our hosts blocked, we leverage distributed systems, such as TOR and PlanetLab. After examining over 100,000 Google accounts, we conclude that 2FA has not yet been adopted by more than 6.4\% of the users. Last but not least, as a side-effect of our technique, we are also able to exfiltrate private information, which can be potentially used for malicious purposes. Thus, in this paper we additionally present important findings for raising concerns about privacy risks in designing password reminders.},

An account secured with 2FA typically requires an individual to authenticate using something they know-- typically a password--as well as something they have, such as a cell phone or hardware token. Many 2FA methods in widespread use today have not been subjected to adequate usability testing. Furthermore, previous 2FA usability research is difficult to compare due to widely-varying contexts across different studies. We conducted a two-week, between-subjects usability study of five common 2FA methods with 72 participants, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Participants logged into a simulated banking website nearly every day using 2FA and completed an assigned task. Participants generally gave high marks to the methods studied, and many expressed an interest in using 2FA to provide more security for their sensitive online accounts. We also conducted a withinsubjects laboratory study with 30 participants to assess the general usability of the setup procedure for the five methods. While a few participants experienced difficulty setting up a hardware token and a one-time password, in general, users found the methods easy to set up.},

  abstract = {: Most people now access all the important areas of their life --- banking, shopping, insurance, medical records, and so on --- simply by sitting at their computer and typing a username and password into a website. Getting access to something this way is called one-factor authentication, because you need to know only one thing to get into the system: the combination of user name and password. In theory, this kind of protection should be reasonably secure; in practice, it's less and less trustworthy. This paper presents an approach to further increase security using a two-factor authentication scheme. This approach required the user to login with a username and password and also generate a One Time Password which will be sent to his email. The One Time Password will be used for authentication any time the user wishes to access a restricted resource. The one time password as the name implies will expire after a single use and after a period of 60 seconds. The system uses random image and text based OTP generation with SHA-512 algorithm and again encryption by using ECC to develop a more secured two factor, one time password. Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) technology was used.},
